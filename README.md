# Hash Code Java template

This is the Team Chibi's template, written in Java, to resolve Hash Code competition problems. 

Hash Code is an annual team programming competition, organized by Google. More details at their [official site](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/).


This template helps with basic input output where the programmer only has to worry about the input and output attributes of the particular problem;
helping coders to focus only on the algorithm.


This template was only used in the 2020 edition, so it can be improved and should be used as a reference

See you there and happy coding :)
